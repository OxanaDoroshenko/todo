**Project description**

**Categories tree**

On the rights side we have category tree. 

Each category has its own list of tasks and shows only them, even if the category has nested categories.

Selected category should be highlighted. 

If no category is selected hide right section with tasks input.

The categories tree may have infinite hierarchy.
